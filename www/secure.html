        <h2>Secure Binaries</h2>
        
        <p>Java Webstart can run with two different security levels: all-permissions and restricted.  
            In all-permissions mode, programs are permitted to read and write files on disk, download content
            from the internet, record from your microphone, and many other things.  While these abilities 
            can make a program much more useful, they also provide the unscruplous programmer the ability 
            to spy on or vandalize the user's computer.  Naturally, many users are cautious about granting 
        all-permissions to an unknown program.</p>
        
        <p>As an alternative, you can run the program in restricted mode.  This causes the Java engine
            to prevent a program from doing anything that could comprimise your system.  Unfortunately, it
            also makes a program much less useful - particularly one which relies on loading documents from 
        either the internet or disk in order to display them.</p>
        
        <p>Fortunately, the security model does allow you to download files from the internet that
            originate on the same server as the web start program.  So if you wish to demo the
            program without risking unkown software running on your system, you can use one of the
        below links with one of the special SVG files listed below.</p>

        <b>SVG URLs that will work in secure mode</b>
        <p>Just run the program, select File/Load URL, 
        and then cut and paste one of these URLs into the input box.</p>
